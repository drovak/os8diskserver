*** Basic how-to guide for using SerialDisk server and handlers ***
Written for: SerialDisk_v0.9.6

INTRODUCTION

At this point, you should have a working "family-of-8" computer with an 
auxiliary teletype interface card. If you are not apt to edit source 
code and such, it is easiest to ensure the address of the card is set to 
40/41 rx/tx. Else, you will have to change the two lines in the handler 
files to set the address to something else. 

Currently, the handlers only support Omnibus machines with the 
traditional M8650/M8655 asynchronous serial card. However, work is being 
done to improve compatibility with earlier machines, as well the DECmate 
series.

COMPILING THE PROGRAMS

Assuming you have a modern machine with the gcc compiler, go ahead and 
clone the os8diskserver repository. 
https://github.com/drovak/os8diskserver

If you have git installed, you probably already know how to do this in 
the command line. Else, you can download the .zip archive directly. 
Extract this in an easy-to-find spot. We'll be doing all of our work 
within that directory.

Once you've extracted the contents, you should see a README and the 
actual distribution files within the SerialDisk_v0.9.6 directory. 

Change directory to 'SerialDisk_v0.9.6/server'. To compile, type 
'gcc -o os8disk server.c'. This should compile the server with no 
warnings or errors. If you have encountered an error, please report it by emailing Kyle Owen (kylevowen@gmail.com). 

To test the server very quickly, just run the server with no arguments: 
'./os8disk'. You should see this printed:

$ ./os8disk
PDP-8 Disk Server for OS/8, v1.0
Usage: ./os8disk -1 system [-2 disk2] [-r 1|2] [-w 1|2] [-b bootloader]

Now it's time to build the handler installer. This is a program that 
will take an OS/8 formatted binary system handler and copy it to the 
correct location on an RK05 disk image. Change your directory to 
'../installer'. To build, type 'gcc -o instlhndl handler_installer.c'. 
This should complete without warnings or errors.

INSTALLING THE SYSTEM HANDLER

To use the handler installer, go grab an RK05 image (in the 
dumprest/simh format) and place it in the ../disks directory. David 
Gesswein's website has many disk images. I personally find 
diagpack2.rk05 (http://www.pdp8online.com/images/images/os8.shtml) 
to be a suitable one. diagpack2.rk05 comes with a working copy of BUILD, 
which is needed later on. Two sample disk images are in the
../disks/original directory. You can copy diagpack2.rk05 into ../disks
for convenience.

Run './instlhdnl' to see its usage. To put the SerialDisk system handler 
on your RK05 image, run 
'./instlhndl ../handler/sys_handler.bin ../disks/diagpack2.rk05', where diagpack2.rk05 is your disk image. 

Beware: this will modify the disk image, so make a backup if you need an 
original copy later on. Running the installation will print out some 
debugging information. It should look something like this:

$ ./instlhndl ../handler/sys_handler.bin ../disks/diagpack2.rk05
Read 454 bytes of disk
Read 573 bytes of handler
Position after leader: 0360
Number of devices: 3
Position of bootloader: 0446
Position of handler: 0602

CONFIGURING THE SERVER

The SerialDisk server requires a configuration file just like the 
dumprest tools. This file is called 'disk.cfg' and is in the server 
directory. Open it up with your favorite text editor and change the 
configuration to suit your needs. The first line is the baud rate, the 
second line is 0 for 1 stop bit, or 1 for two stop bits, and the last 
line is the name of your serial device. 

STARTING THE SERVER

At this point, we're ready to start the server. The server can handle up 
to two disk images. To start the server, change the directory back to 
'../server' and run './os8disk -1 ../disks/diagpack2.rk05'. The '-1' 
tells the disk server that the following image should be mounted as the 
primary disk.

If your communications interfaces are all connected, you should see the 
following:

$ ./os8disk -1 ../disks/diagpack2.rk05
PDP-8 Disk Server for OS/8, v1.0
Using system disk ../disks/diagpack2.rk05 with read enabled and write 
enabled
Using serial port /dev/ttyUSB0 at 19200 with 2 stop bits

If there are errors opening a file or device, check the file or device 
name and try again. 

To stop the server for any reason, press control-C followed by y[enter]. 
Be mindful: when you press this, the server is interrupted. Data will be 
lost if the PDP-8 is writing to the disk. It is typically best to stop 
the server when the PDP-8 is not transacting data.

BOOTING TO OS/8

The time has come to get your PDP-8 online with OS/8. We need to load 
the bootloader into the computer. This is technically short enough to 
load directly in by hand, but if you prefer, toggle in the RIM loader 
and load the bootloader that way. You are likely familiar with the 
sendtape utility (from the dumprest collection, 
ftp://ftp.pdp8online.com/software/dumprest), but if you are not, please 
familiarize yourself with David Gesswein's project. 

Assuming you have loaded the RIM loader, 
'sendtape ../bootloader/bootloader.rim' will send the bootloader to the 
PDP-8. After you have loaded with sendtape, you can switch your console 
teletype or terminal back on.

Once the bootloader is loaded, make sure the server is still running and 
start the PDP-8 at 0020. This will tell the server to send the first 
block on the disk to the PDP-8, which will continue the boot process by 
loading the system into the high pages of fields 0 and 1. If all goes 
well, your terminal connected to the console port should be displaying 
the dot prompt. I'm using minicom and it looks like this: 

Welcome to minicom 2.4

OPTIONS: I18n
Compiled on Sep  7 2010, 01:26:06.
Port /dev/ttyUSB1

Press CTRL-A Z for help on special keys


.

The server window should look something like this after the initial 
boot:

$ ./os8disk -1 ../disks/diagpack2.rk05
PDP-8 Disk Server for OS/8, v1.0
Using system disk ../disks/diagpack2.rk05 with read enabled and write 
enabled
Using serial port /dev/ttyUSB0 at 19200 with 2 stop bits
Request to read 8 pages to side 0 on system disk
Buffer address 00000, starting block 00007
Successfully completed read

Congrats! But you're not done yet. There's no way to access the second 
partition until we re-BUILD the system. 

REBUILDING OS/8

We successfully tricked OS/8 into booting by sneakily replacing the 
system handler and bootloader on the disk. However, BUILD, RESORC, and 
PIP (for instance) have no idea that we actually changed the system 
handler. To remedy this, we will need to rebuild OS/8 with BUILD.

First though, we must get the system and non-system handlers onto the 
disk and assemble them. We can use OS/8's EDIT to do this.

.R EDIT
*SYS:DSKNSY.PA<

#A[enter]

EDIT is now ready to accept the text file. You can send 
'../handler/nonsys_handler.pal' with your favorite terminal emulator. 
You may need to increase the character delay in order to get an accurate 
transfer depending on the baud rate. 3 ms character delay and 20 ms line 
delay is often a good starting point. If there is an error in 
transmission, return to command mode with a control-L and then type 
K[enter] to kill the buffer. Start over by typing A[enter] to append to 
the now empty buffer.

Once done, press [enter] once, then control-L to get back to command 
mode, then type E[enter]. This will end the EDIT session and dump the 
buffer to disk.

Run EDIT again, and this time make a new file called 'SYS:DSKSYS.PA'. 
Send it '../handler/sys_handler.pal' the same way you sent the other. 

Once you've sent the two files, it's time to assemble them.

.R PAL8
*SYS:DSKNSY.BN<SYS:DSKNSY
ERRORS DETECTED: 0
LINKS GENERATED: 0

.R PAL8
*SYS:DSKSYS.BN<SYS:DSKSYS
ERRORS DETECTED: 0
LINKS GENERATED: 0

Congrats again. You've just assembled two handlers. You're now ready to 
insert them into BUILD.

.RUN SYS BUILD

$

Let's look at what devices are already LOaded in BUILD:

$PR

BAT : *BAT
KL8E: *TTY
LPSV: *LPT
RK8E: *SYS   RKA0  RKB0
RK05: *RKA0 *RKB0 *RKA1 *RKB1  RKA2  RKB2  RKA3  RKB3
RX02: *RXA0 *RXA1
TD8A: *DTA0 *DTA1
RL0 : *RL0A *RL0B

DSK=RK8E:SYS
$

You can see there are lots of handlers already in place with this 
particular disk image. I don't have any other storage mediums on this 
list, so I've UNloaded all of the unnecessary ones. You will need to 
UNload a few (or at least DElete a couple) so that the new handlers will 
fit.

$UN BAT

$UN LPSV

$UN RK8E

$UN RK05

$UN RX02

$UN TD8A

$UN RL0

$

Now we can LOad the newly-assembled handlers into BUILD.

$LO SYS:DSKNSY

$LO SYS:DSKSYS

$PR

KL8E: *TTY
SRV :  SYS   SRV0  SRV1
SDSK:  SD0   SD1   SD2   SD3

DSK=RK8E:SYS
$

Let's INsert the handlers we need and configure DSK: to a valid handler. 
As it is currently, SYS=SRV0=SD0 and SRV1=SD1; that is, they point to 
the same partitions on the server, which are the two partitions on the 
first disk. SD2 and SD3 point to the two partitions on the optional 
second disk. However, SDSK is the non-system handler and can be used 
even if your system disk is not the SerialDisk server.

$IN SRV:SYS,SRV1

$IN SDSK:SD0,SD1,SD2,SD3

$DSK=SYS

$PR

KL8E: *TTY
SRV : *SYS   SRV0 *SRV1
SDSK: *SD0  *SD1  *SD2  *SD3

DSK=SRV:SYS
$

I've chosen DSK: as SYS (the first partition on the primary disk), but 
this can be SRV1: if you prefer. 

Now it's time to BOot the system, configuring it the way we have 
described. Once built, save BUILD so that next time we call it for 
modifications, it knows what the current configuration is. 
Unfortunately, SYS: is virtually full right now (with one block free), 
so you'll have to save it to SD1:. No worries; you can copy it over to 
SYS: later once you free up some blocks.

$BO
SYS BUILT
.SAVE SD1 BUILD

.

That's it! You're all done. To test out the handlers, try printing the 
directory of SD1. If this works, you know you've successfully gotten the 
handlers installed.

.DIR SD1:/P



ABSLDR.SV   6            RL2SY .BH   2            DHTAAC.DG  17
[snip]
RLC   .BH   2            DHLAAB.DG  13            BUILD .SV  37

 159 Files in 2810 Blocks -  382 Free blocks

.

You may have a different file/block count. I played around with the disk 
image a little before making the tutorial.

If this worked, congratulations. You now have a booting OS/8 system! You 
try bootloading the machine again to make sure BUILD worked correctly 
installing the bootloader. 

CONCLUSION

Since you now have a fully-functional system, try out some programs. 
BASIC works fine once you copy it to the SYS: partition. Again, you'll 
need to delete some files from SYS: if you want to copy some programs 
over. Try re-running the server with '-2 ../disks/diag-games-kermit.rk05' 
on the end to use the SD2 and SD3 partitions. This will allow systems
(with enough memory) to play with MUSIC.SV, Adventure, etc. Note: you do 
not have to halt the PDP-8 to swap out disks. Just make sure no data is 
being transacted at the time you halt the server, and make sure the SYS: 
disk stays the same unless you really know what you're doing.

Remember, you still need to patch PIP and RESORC if you want to use them 
with the new devices. Consult the OS/8 Handbook for patching procedures.

If you had any trouble along the way, or you think you can make this 
tutorial better, please email Kyle Owen (kylevowen@gmail.com) so the 
appropriate changes can be made.

Have fun with OS/8!
